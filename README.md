# Udumate E-Course Project

This project is an e-learning platform built to showcase a few courses that I have completed. Its purpose is to provide educators or companies with a content where they can create, add, delete, and update their courses. Users can view these courses with their details.

The site also includes a separate panel that can only be accessed by users with admin roles. In this panel, purchase transactions can be managed. When users want to buy a course, they can enter their virtual payment information through Stripe after completing the necessary steps, and also see the order confirmation mail.

The user-related information and its accessibility and management are implemented using the features provided by the Identity library.
